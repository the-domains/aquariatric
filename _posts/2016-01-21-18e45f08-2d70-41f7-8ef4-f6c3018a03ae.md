When you look at the different stages of a storm -- from the outside and the inside -- you find the most varied states and effects: from foreboding to the rage within or from being caught in its eye to the sheer power of a passing storm and the sudden calm which follows. For choreographer Terence Kohler these become a metaphor to penetrate the landscapes of the soul of the music he has chosen as the score for his first creation for the Ballett am Rhein: Johannes Brahms' Symphony No.1 -- a score in which Brahms, pressured by the great past of his predecessors and repeatedly expressing regret at having been born too late, discovered a music over the course of a creative process lasting 22 years which takes its place within that tradition while transforming everything traditional into something subjective and deeply personal.
